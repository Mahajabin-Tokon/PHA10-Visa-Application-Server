## Description

The VisaPro Backend is a RESTful API designed to power the VisaPro platform, a comprehensive solution for managing visa applications, tracking user-submitted data, and maintaining visa-related operations. Built with modern backend technologies, it provides secure, scalable, and efficient data handling to deliver a seamless experience to end users.

## Packages Used

- **Express**: Framework for creating the API endpoints and handling server operations.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing and managing visa-related data.
- **Cors**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing frontend communication.
- **Dotenv**: For managing environment variables securely.

## Key Features

1. **CRUD Operations for Visas**:
   - **GET `/latestVisas`**: Fetches the most recently added visas, sorted by their creation time.
   - **GET `/visas`**: Retrieves all visa entries in the database.
   - **GET `/visaDetails/:id`**: Fetches detailed information about a specific visa using its ID.
   - **POST `/visas`**: Adds a new visa entry to the database.
   - **PUT `/myAddedVisas/:id`**: Updates an existing visa with user-provided details.
   - **DELETE `/myAddedVisas/:id`**: Deletes a visa entry by its ID.

2. **User-Specific Data Handling**:
   - **GET `/myAddedVisas`**: Fetches visas added by a specific user, filtered by their email.
   - **PATCH `/myAddedVisas/:id`**: Updates the application status for a specific visa.

3. **Robust Middleware**:
   - Integrated `cors` for handling requests from the frontend hosted on a different domain.
   - `express.json` to parse JSON payloads in incoming requests.

4. **Environment-Specific Configuration**:
   - MongoDB connection string and API keys securely managed using `dotenv`.

5. **Database Integration**:
   - MongoDB Atlas connection using the official Node.js driver for efficient data operations.

6. **Deployment Ready**:
   - Configured for deployment on Vercel using the `vercel.json` file, with support for all HTTP methods.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT-based authentication to secure endpoints and restrict access based on user roles.

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Add robust validation for request payloads using libraries like Joi or Yup to ensure data integrity.

3. **Analytics and Reporting**:
   - Introduce endpoints for generating reports and analytics on user activity and visa application trends.
